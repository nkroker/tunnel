# Project Requirements: Ngrok Alternative

## Overview
Need to create a new project which is going to be an alternative to the ngrok tunnel.

The project will be a simple web server that will be used to create a tunnel to the internet and also we need a client that will use this tunnel to connect the local server to the webapp and all the request will be proxied through the web server to the client and then to the local server.

## Core Technologies
- Nodejs for both the web server and the client
- Typescript for the client
- Express for the web server
- React for the client
- Tailwind for the UI
- Supabase for the database

## System Architecture

### Components
1. Web Server (Tunnel Server)
2. Client Application
3. Local Server (user's application)
4. Web Interface (React Dashboard)

### Additional Technical Requirements
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- JWT for authentication
- Redis for managing active tunnels
- Docker for containerization
- Environment configuration
- Logging system

## Detailed Component Specifications

### 1. Tunnel Server (NodeJS/Express)
- Handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests
- Manage WebSocket connections
- Route traffic to appropriate clients
- Authentication and authorization
- Tunnel management
- Load balancing (if needed)

### 2. Client Application (TypeScript)
- Connect to tunnel server
- Handle incoming requests
- Forward requests to local server
- Configuration management
- Status monitoring

### 3. Database Schema (Supabase)
- Users management
- Tunnels configuration
- Usage tracking
- Analytics storage

### 4. Web Interface (React + Tailwind)
- User authentication
- Tunnel management dashboard
- Real-time tunnel status
- Traffic monitoring
- Configuration settings

## Security Requirements
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Input validation
- Security headers

## Monitoring Requirements
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage statistics

## DevOps Requirements
- CI/CD pipeline
- Docker containers
- Environment management
- Backup strategy

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up the project structure and monorepo
2. Implement basic tunnel server with WebSocket support
3. Create client application with local server proxying
4. Set up Supabase and authentication
5. Build React dashboard with basic functionality
6. Implement tunnel management and monitoring
7. Add security features
8. Set up Docker and deployment
9. Add monitoring and logging
10. Test and optimize

## Additional Tools

### Development
- `pnpm` for package management
- `jest` for testing
- `eslint` and `prettier` for code quality
- `zod` for runtime type validation

### Monitoring
- `winston` for logging
- `prometheus` for metrics
- `sentry` for error tracking

### DevOps
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker Compose for local development
- Nginx for reverse proxy
